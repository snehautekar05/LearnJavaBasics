// To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, you can use the relationship between LCM and GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):


// LCM(a, b) = (|a * b|)/{GCD(a, b)}

// This formula is efficient because calculating the GCD is straightforward using the Euclidean algorithm. Once you have the GCD, you can easily compute the LCM.

// Least Common Multiple (LCM)
// The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. In other words, it's the smallest number that both original numbers can divide without leaving a remainder.

// Example
// Let's find the LCM of 12 and 18:

// Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...
// Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, ...
// The common multiples of 12 and 18 are 36, 72, etc. The smallest of these is 36, so the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36.

// Using the GCD to Find LCM
// You can also use the relationship between LCM and GCD:
// LCM(a, b) = (|a * b|)/{GCD(a, b)}

// For 12 and 18:

// GCD is 6.
// LCM = (12 Ã— 18) / 6 = 36.
// So, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36.
